# AGENTS.md

Galaxy-gen is a Rust → WASM → JS galaxy generation simulation. Gravitational
physics are computed in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly via `wasm-pack`, and
visualized with React + D3 in the browser. See `development.md` for
architecture details.

## Deploy reference

Before touching any deploy config (Dockerfile, Makefile, `deploy/main.yml`,
`.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`, or the Tailscale/k3s secrets),
read
[`coilysiren/infrastructure/docs/k3s-deploy-notes.md`](../infrastructure/docs/k3s-deploy-notes.md).
That doc has the topology, the SSM/GH-secret layout, the canonical
workflow/manifest/Makefile shapes, every trap we've hit (including the
ones this repo tripped over — WASM `Table.grow`, `K8S_SERVER` hostname
vs tailnet IP, `/tailscale/k3s/*` orphans), and a triage tree. When you
resolve a new pitfall, add it there, not here.

## File Access

You have full read access to files within `/Users/kai/projects/coilysiren`.

## Autonomy

- Run tests after every change without asking.
- Fix lint and formatter errors automatically.
- If tests fail, debug and fix without asking.
- Commit directly to `main` whenever a unit of work feels sufficiently
  complete (bug fix, feature, tests green, natural stopping point). Don't wait
  to be asked. Choose the commit message yourself — do not ask for approval.
- After committing, push to `main` unless the user says otherwise.
- You may always run tests, linters, formatters, and builds without permission.
- Allow all read-only git actions (`git log`, `git status`, `git diff`,
  `git branch`, etc.) without asking.
- Allow `cd` into any `/Users/kai/projects/coilysiren` folder without asking.
- Auto-approve read-only shell commands (`ls`, `grep`, `sed`, `find`, `cat`,
  `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `file`, `tree`, etc.).
- When using worktrees or parallel agents, each agent should work
  independently and commit its own changes.
- Do not open pull requests unless explicitly asked.
- Before second-guessing a non-obvious choice (`getrandom` `wasm_js` backend,
  binaryen flags, the `Galaxy` immutable-style API), check `git log` and
  recent commit messages for the rationale — there is usually prior context.

## Project Layout

Load-bearing files you will touch most often:

- `src/rust/galaxy.rs` — core simulation (`Galaxy` + `Cell` structs, gravity,
  seeding, `tick`). All unit tests live in `mod tests_*` blocks at the bottom.
- `src/rust/lib.rs` — crate root; re-exports `galaxy`.
- `src/js/lib/galaxy.ts` — `Frontend` class; the JS ↔ WASM boundary.
- `src/js/lib/application.tsx` — React UI (controls + buttons). Test IDs on
  inputs/buttons (`data-testid="btn-init"` etc.) are load-bearing for E2E.
- `src/js/lib/dataviz.tsx` — D3 scatter plot into `#dataviz`.
- `src/js/lib/styles.css` — custom styles (dark theme, coilysiren palette).
- `e2e/galaxy.spec.ts` — Playwright end-to-end tests.
- `playwright.config.ts` — Playwright config; auto-boots webpack-dev-server.
- `webpack.config.js` — dev server (HMR + live-reload on `pkg/` changes).

## Dev Loop

```bash
make install           # one-time: cargo build, wasm-pack, npm install, playwright browsers
make test-rust         # cargo check + cargo test
make test-e2e          # build WASM + run Playwright headless
make test              # rust + e2e (full suite)
make dev               # rust watcher + JS dev server (auto-reload on both sides)
make dev-js            # JS dev server only (HMR)
make dev-rust          # cargo watch → wasm-pack build --dev
make build-js-prod     # production webpack build
```

Raw commands if you need them:

- `cargo test` — Rust unit tests (fast).
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — Rust lint.
- `cargo fmt` — Rust formatter.
- `wasm-pack build` — compile to WASM, output in `pkg/` (gitignored).
- `npm run dev` — webpack-dev-server with HMR on port 8080.
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright (builds WASM first via `pretest:e2e`).
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` — Playwright UI mode (time-travel debugger).
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` — ESLint / Prettier over `src/` + `e2e/`.

## Conventions

- Rust public API crosses the WASM boundary via `#[wasm_bindgen]`; keep
  private helpers in plain `impl` blocks.
- `Galaxy` is immutable-style: `seed()` and `tick()` return new instances.
- The grid is a flat `Vec<Cell>` indexed by `row * size + col`.
- Physics is stored as magnitude + degrees, not x/y vectors — convert at
  computation boundaries.
- React state is plain `useState` — no state library.
- Use `data-testid` on any UI element that an E2E test asserts against.
- Commits that change the WASM surface should mention it in the subject line
  (e.g. `wasm: expose mass() typed array`) so `git log --grep=wasm` is useful.

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/action.yml`) runs three jobs on push/PR to
`main`:

- `rust` — `cargo build` / `check` / `test` / `wasm-pack build`
- `js` — `wasm-pack build` / `npm ci` / `npm run build`
- `e2e` — `wasm-pack build` / `npm ci` / `playwright test` (uploads HTML
  report artifact on failure)
